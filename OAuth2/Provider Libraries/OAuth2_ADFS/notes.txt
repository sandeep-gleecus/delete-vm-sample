Windows Server 2012 R2 domain controllers have a default for the security setting named "Allow cryptography algorithms compatible with Windows NT 4.0" that
prevents weaker cryptography algorithms when establishing security channel sessions.
For more information about this setting, see Knowledge Base article 942564 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=104751).

The domain name "adfs_test.local" contains the underscore character (_). Microsoft DNS servers allow underscore characters in the DNS records. However, other
DNS server products may not.

This computer has at least one physical network adapter that does not have static IP address(es) assigned to its IP Properties. If both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled
for a network adapter, both IPv4 and IPv6 static IP addresses should be assigned to both IPv4 and IPv6 Properties of the physical network adapter. Such static IP
address(es) assignment should be done to all the physical network adapters for reliable Domain Name System (DNS) operation.

A delegation for this DNS server cannot be created because the authoritative parent zone cannot be found or it does not run Windows DNS server. If you are
integrating with an existing DNS infrastructure, you should manually create a delegation to this DNS server in the parent zone to ensure reliable name resolution
from outside the domain "adfs_test.local". Otherwise, no action is required.
